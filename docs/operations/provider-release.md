# Release a provider version

> Last updated: 2026-09-11 · commit `ef7b5a9aa`

Runbook for shipping a new `darkbloom` provider CLI: bump the two version
constants, land the changelog, push a `vX.Y.Z` tag, approve the `prod`
environment, and let [`.github/workflows/release-swift.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-swift.yml)
build, sign, notarize, hash, upload, and register the bundle. The coordinator
verifies every registered artifact by re-downloading it, so a release either
lands fully or not at all.

The prepared version is **0.9.2**; its source changes since `v0.9.1` are
collected in [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md). The version bump prepares
the source for the provider bundle. Publication and coordinator deployment remain
separate operations; the bump alone does not change the registered release
returned by `GET /v1/releases/latest`.

### Provider-only 0.9.2 rollout

A coordinator binary upgrade is not required solely to register 0.9.2. The
0.9.1 coordinator already validates and stores the release, refreshes active
binary/metallib trust, preserves other active releases and serves the new
version through `GET /v1/releases/latest`. `LatestProviderVersion` is a display
fallback, not an exact-version admission pin (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`,
`handleRegisterRelease`; `coordinator/api/server.go`, `SyncBinaryHashes` and
`SyncRuntimeManifest`).

The 0.9.2 assistant transition uses existing slot state `reloading`, capacity
quotes and 503 `slot_state` refusals; accepted requests keep their old engine
until the swap (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+MTPDrain.swift`,
`beginMTPUpgradeDrain` and `rejectIfDrainingForMTP`). It can temporarily reduce
Gemma capacity. Rollout jitter spreads attempts but does not guarantee fleet
headroom. Coordinator warm-pool headroom changes are a separate deployment.

Before fleet publication, complete the outstanding checks in the
[0.9.2 rollout review](../reports/2026-09-10-provider-092-rollout-review.md)
on the exact signed candidate against the existing coordinator. Verify mixed
0.9.1/0.9.2 trust, real requests during assistant download/drain/swap, cache
identity changes and restart. Preserve existing cache-routing controls: local
Gemma SSD reuse does not enable coordinator holder selection, and HF-first
assistant downloads require the separate catalog metadata update.

After an approved provider-only publication, verify the registered version
and actual inference separately. `/health` should retain the previous
coordinator `build_commit`; its build `version` can remain 0.9.1 while
`/v1/releases/latest` returns 0.9.2. Registration exposes the release to
provider auto-update; it is not a limited canary rollout by itself.

## Environment-free signing validation

[`provider-signing-validation.yml`](../../.github/workflows/provider-signing-validation.yml)
is a separate manual workflow for a reviewed full `source_sha` and its existing
`version`. It has no GitHub `environment` field or environment selector and no
coordinator registration, R2 upload, GitHub Release, tag or deployment step.
Its token has only `contents: read` and `actions: read`.

The build job has no signing secrets. It checks the source's verified commit
signature and version parity, builds the exact provider and metallib, then stages
an unsigned app with the existing SwiftPM resource helper. A new runner downloads
that same run's artifact, verifies its inventory/source/version, rejects unsafe
archive paths and links, and checks the candidate entitlements against the
reviewed workflow tooling (`scripts/provider-signing-validation.py`).

Unpacking limits the compressed archive and total declared member bytes to
2 GiB, each member to 512 MiB, and the archive to 16,384 members. Normalized
duplicate paths, including case aliases, are refused. The app's bundle ID,
executable name and both version fields must match the expected source before
signing and when the final receipt is written.

The signing job uses repository-scoped `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`,
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`, `APPLE_ID` and
`APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`. It imports an isolated temporary keychain, validates the
profile's team, keychain group, production APNs grant, expiry and declared
application identity (`scripts/provider-signing-validation.py`, `profile`). Both
`com.apple.application-identifier` and `application-identifier` are checked when
present: each must name the exact provider team/app or a wildcard that covers
it. Profiles may omit those declarations; conflicting, malformed or unrelated
declarations fail validation. The job signs the normal app components, then
checks the signed CLI's keychain group, APNs entitlement and disabled debug-task
entitlement. It checks Apple notarization and a stapled ticket, and emits
post-sign file hashes. Keychain material is removed even on failure. Only explicit Actions
artifacts and non-secret notarization diagnostics are retained for three days.

The normal APNs entitlement retains its required `production` value; this is a
static signing entitlement, not a GitHub environment or a provider registration.
The workflow never executes the candidate CLI, helper, model or inference server.
Signed runtime smoke, installation, model correctness and release approval remain
separate gates. The original release workflow's `validation_only` option still
selects a deployment environment and is not this isolated path.

Review and make the new manual workflow available before authorizing a dispatch.
Source preparation and the CPU helper tests do not claim a completed signing run:

```bash
python3 scripts/test-provider-signing-validation.py
```

## When to use

- Shipping a provider release to the fleet (production coordinator
  `api.darkbloom.dev`).
- Publishing a dev build to the dev coordinator for testing
  (`workflow_dispatch` with `environment=dev`).
- Building a signed, notarized validation bundle for isolated tests
  (`environment=dev`, `validation_only=true`).

Coordinator deploys are a separate runbook:
[`coordinator-deploy.md`](coordinator-deploy.md).

## Prerequisites

- Write access to the repo; the release branch is `master` and CI is green.
- Rights to approve deployments to the `prod` GitHub environment (the `release`
  job binds `environment: ${{ needs.resolve-env.outputs.environment }}`, so a
  production tag waits on the environment's protection rules). **A production
  release is a production mutation; get the approval from a second human.**
- Repository secrets (repo-level, prefixed per environment; the workflow's
  "Resolve env-specific secrets" step picks `DEV_*` or `PROD_*` and falls back
  to the unprefixed legacy names):

  | Secret | Used for |
  |---|---|
  | `DEV_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `PROD_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DEV_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `PROD_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DEV_R2_ENDPOINT` / `PROD_R2_ENDPOINT`, `DEV_R2_BUCKET` / `PROD_R2_BUCKET` | `aws s3 cp` upload of the bundle to R2 |
  | `DEV_R2_PUBLIC_URL` / `PROD_R2_PUBLIC_URL` | Public CDN base used in the registered `url`; must equal the coordinator's `EIGENINFERENCE_R2_CDN_URL` |
  | `DEV_COORDINATOR_URL` / `PROD_COORDINATOR_URL` | Target of `POST /v1/releases` |
  | `DEV_RELEASE_KEY` / `PROD_RELEASE_KEY` | Bearer token for `POST /v1/releases`; must equal the coordinator's `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_KEY` |
  | legacy fallbacks `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, `COORDINATOR_URL`, `RELEASE_KEY`, variable `R2_BUCKET` | used only when the prefixed secret is empty |
  | `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12`, `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Developer ID Application certificate (`Eigen Labs, Inc. (SLDQ2GJ6TL)`) imported into a temporary keychain |
  | `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | Embedded in `Darkbloom.app`; must grant `aps-environment=production` |
  | `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` | `xcrun notarytool submit … --team-id SLDQ2GJ6TL` |

- The coordinator that will receive the registration has
  `EIGENINFERENCE_RELEASE_KEY` and `EIGENINFERENCE_R2_CDN_URL` set
  (`coordinator/api/server_config.go`); without the CDN URL registration fails
  with `503 not_configured`.

## Steps

### 1. Bump the version in both places

The provider and coordinator versions must be identical strings:

- `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderCore.swift` — `public static let version = "0.9.2"`
- `coordinator/api/server.go` — `var LatestProviderVersion = "0.9.2"`

```bash
./scripts/check-release-version.sh          # provider == coordinator, semver
./scripts/sync-install-embed.sh check       # coordinator/api/install.sh == scripts/install.sh
```

`check-release-version.sh` accepts an optional expected version
(`check-release-version.sh v0.9.2`) and an optional reported string from a
built binary (`darkbloom 0.9.2` or `0.9.2`); the workflow calls it in all
three forms. CI job "Release Integrity" runs the two commands above on every
push. Do not touch `minProviderVersionForDesiredModels` (`"0.5.17"`, same file)
for a routine release; it is the floor for desired-model fan-out, not the
current version.

### 2. Write the changelog entry

`CHANGELOG.md` is hand-written, newest first. Convention (from the existing
headings): while in development the top section is
`## Unreleased (YYYY-MM-DD) — <theme>`; at release time rename it to
`## vX.Y.Z (shipped; YYYY-MM-DD)` (or `## Release candidate vX.Y.Z (not
shipped; YYYY-MM-DD)` for a candidate that was tagged but not promoted).
Bullets start with a bold lead-in (`- **Per-request profiler** — …`) and name
exact identifiers (tables, env vars, message fields). Nothing in the pipeline
reads `CHANGELOG.md`; the release row's `changelog` field comes from the **tag
message** (step 4), so write the tag message from this entry.

### 3. Merge to `master` and wait for CI

Open a PR with the bump + changelog; "Release Integrity", "Provider Tests",
"Coordinator Tests", and "E2E Integration Tests" must be green. The release
workflow re-runs `scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh` itself, so a prompt-contract
change that is not fixture-synced will fail the release, not just CI.

### 4. Tag and push (production)

```bash
git checkout master && git pull --ff-only
git tag -a v0.9.2 -m "v0.9.2 — <one-line theme>

<body: the changelog bullets for this release>"
git push origin v0.9.2
```

Accepted tag patterns (`on.push.tags`): `v*.*.*`, `v*-swift`, `v*-swift.*`.
Tags containing `-dev.` are rejected by `resolve-env` ("`-dev` tags are
unsupported by the exact-version release contract"); use step 5 for dev.
The version is derived from the tag (`v` stripped, `-swift*` suffix stripped)
and must equal the source constants. `scripts/resolve-provider-release.sh` checks
this before writing job outputs or requesting environment approval.

### 5. Dev release (manual dispatch)

```bash
gh workflow run release-swift.yml --ref <branch> -f environment=dev
# optional: -f version_override=0.9.2
```

Without a tag the version is read from `ProviderCore.swift` (or
`version_override`, which must still match the source). `environment=prod`
without a tag is refused ("Production publication requires a source-matching
release tag"). Dev releases use `DEV_*` secrets, register with the dev
coordinator, and create no GitHub Release.

### Signed validation bundle

To test a source revision before release registration, dispatch the same signing,
notarization and final-bundle smoke pipeline in validation mode:

```bash
gh workflow run release-swift.yml --ref <branch> -f environment=dev -f validation_only=true
gh run download <run-id> --name darkbloom-signed-validation-<commit>-<attempt> --dir <new-directory>
```

The branch and recursive submodule commits must be available to CI. Source version
checks and the dev environment's approval rules still apply. This mode needs the
Apple signing/profile/notarization secrets; it skips publication-secret resolution,
R2 uploads, release registration and GitHub Release creation. The default remains
`validation_only=false` for ordinary releases.

The Actions artifact contains the final signed tarball and
`darkbloom-validation-identity.json`, with source/submodule revisions and final
bundle, executable and metallib hashes. Retention is 14 days. Verify those hashes
before an isolated model or persistent-cache restart test, and retain the artifact
with that test's evidence. A successful artifact build does not establish restart
durability or authorize rollout.

### 6. Approve the environment deployment

In the Actions run, approve the pending `prod` (or `dev`) deployment. The
`release` job then runs on `macos` with these steps, in order (step names as
shown in the run):

| # | Step | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Checkout (with submodules) | `fetch-depth: 0` so `gh release --generate-notes` has history |
| 2 | Validate release version integrity | `scripts/check-release-version.sh "$VERSION"` |
| 3 | Import Developer ID certificate | temp keychain from `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_P12` |
| 4 | Install awscli (R2) · Restore SwiftPM cache · Discard metallibs restored by the generic SwiftPM cache | tooling and cache hygiene — a cached metallib is never trusted |
| 5 | Verify production prompt parity | `scripts/verify-prompt-parity.sh` |
| 6 | Build source-matched mlx.metallib through root helper | `scripts/fetch-metallib.sh "$RUNNER_TEMP/metallib"` with `MLX_METALLIB_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=26.2`; cached by MLX source SHA + helper SHA |
| 7 | Build provider-swift (release) | `swift build -c release --product darkbloom`, `darkbloom-enclave`, `darkbloom-fan-helper`; the built binary's `--version` is checked with `check-release-version.sh "$VERSION" "$REPORTED"` |
| 8 | Embed provisioning profile | decodes `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`; fails unless the profile grants `aps-environment=production` and has no `get-task-allow` |
| 9 | Stage and sign bundle | stages `Darkbloom.app` (CLI, enclave, fan helper, `mlx.metallib`, every SwiftPM resource bundle via `scripts/stage-swiftpm-resource-bundles.sh`) plus a flat `bin/` layout; `codesign --options runtime --timestamp` on the metallib first, then each binary, then the bundle; `codesign --verify --deep --strict`; tars to `darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| 10 | Notarize bundle | `xcrun notarytool submit --wait --timeout 15m`; on failure prints `notarytool log`; then `xcrun stapler staple` + `stapler validate`, re-verifies codesign, **rebuilds the tar**, and asserts the file list contains `./bin/darkbloom`, `./bin/darkbloom-enclave`, `./bin/mlx.metallib`, every resource bundle and `pagedattention.metal`. A smoke extract runs the CLI and re-checks the version |
| 11 | Hashes | computed **after** signing, notarizing, stapling and the tar rebuild: `BINARY_HASH = sha256(bin/darkbloom)` from the extracted tar, `BUNDLE_HASH = sha256(tar.gz)`, `METALLIB_HASH = sha256(flat mlx.metallib)` |
| 12 | Upload bundle to R2 | `s3://$R2_BUCKET/releases/v$VERSION/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz`, plus `releases/latest/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz` and the legacy `releases/latest/eigeninference-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz` |
| 13 | Register release with coordinator | `POST $COORDINATOR_URL/v1/releases` (below) |
| 14 | Create GitHub Release | prod + tag only: `gh release create <tag> <tar.gz> --notes-file … --generate-notes`; notes list the source commit (`$GITHUB_SHA`), the three hashes, signer, "Notarized: yes", `Min macOS: 14.0`, and the `curl -fsSL <coordinator>/install.sh \| bash` install line |
| 15 | Cleanup keychain | always |

The registration payload (`coordinator/api/release_handlers.go`,
`registerReleaseRequest`; unknown fields are rejected):

```json
{
  "version": "0.9.2",
  "platform": "macos-arm64",
  "backend": "mlx-swift",
  "binary_hash": "<sha256 of bin/darkbloom>",
  "bundle_hash": "<sha256 of the tar.gz>",
  "metallib_hash": "<sha256 of mlx.metallib>",
  "url": "<R2_PUBLIC_URL>/releases/v0.9.2/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz",
  "changelog": "<tag subject + body, or 'Release v0.9.2'>"
}
```

`handleRegisterRelease` requires `Authorization: Bearer <RELEASE_KEY>`,
validates semver/platform/hex, requires `metallib_hash` when `backend` is
`mlx-swift`, requires `url` to equal exactly
`<EIGENINFERENCE_R2_CDN_URL>/releases/v<version>/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz`
(`trustedReleaseArtifactURL`), then **downloads the bundle** (2 GiB cap,
2-minute timeout), checks `bundle_hash`, extracts `bin/darkbloom` and checks
`binary_hash` (`verifyReleaseArtifact`). Only then does it `SetRelease`,
resync the binary-hash policy (`SyncBinaryHashes`, `SyncRuntimeManifest`), and
invalidate the cached `/api/version` and `/v1/releases/latest` responses.
Response: `{"status":"release_registered","release":{…}}`.

Registration is safe against the live fleet: the rebuilt runtime manifest is
the union of every active release's hashes, so providers still on the previous
version keep passing their challenges through the self-update window
([auto-update cadence](../provider/cli-reference.md#runtime-constants)). Their
hashes leave the manifest only when that release is deactivated
([Rollback](#rollback)); the mechanism is in
[runtime manifest](../architecture/security/attestation.md#runtime-manifest).

## Verification

```bash
COORD=https://api.darkbloom.dev
curl -fsS "$COORD/v1/releases/latest?platform=macos-arm64" | jq .   # version, hashes, url, changelog
curl -fsS "$COORD/api/version" | jq .                                # same row (falls back to LatestProviderVersion when no release exists)
curl -fsS "$COORD/v1/admin/releases" -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" | jq '.releases[] | {version, active, created_at}'
```

- `GET /v1/releases/latest` returns the **highest active semver** for the
  platform (`GetLatestRelease` in `coordinator/store/postgres.go`, ordered by
  `releaseVersionGreater` in `coordinator/store/release_version.go`), not the
  most recently registered row.
- Install on a clean Mac: `curl -fsSL $COORD/install.sh | bash`;
  `scripts/install.sh` reads `/v1/releases/latest` and verifies the bundle
  hash before installing. `darkbloom --version` must print the new version.
- Connected providers pick the release up through the background auto-update
  monitor (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/ProviderLoop+AutoUpdate.swift`:
  initial delay 5 m, interval 30 m, disabled by `auto_update=false` or
  `DARKBLOOM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`), which reads
  `/v1/releases/latest?platform=macos-arm64`
  (`provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Update/SelfUpdater.swift`). Watch the
  Datadog gauge `providers.per_version` (tag `version:<x.y.z>`, emitted from
  `coordinator/api/server.go` via `registry.ProviderCountByVersion`) converge
  over the next hour.
- If the release-policy gate is enforced, confirm evidence for the new binary
  hash is accepted: see
  [`release-policy-rollout.md`](release-policy-rollout.md)
  ("Verification").
- Coordinator log line: `release registered` with `version` and a truncated
  `binary_hash`.

## Rollback

A registered release is immutable (hash-pinned); rollback means **deactivating
it** so the previous active version becomes "latest" again.

1. Deactivate the bad release (admin key or Privy admin):

   ```bash
   curl -fsS -X DELETE "$COORD/v1/admin/releases" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"version":"0.9.2","platform":"macos-arm64"}'
   ```

   `handleAdminDeleteRelease` answers `409 release_in_use` while connected
   providers still run that `binary_hash` (in-use protection is active when
   binary-hash enforcement is on **or** a release inventory has ever been
   published). Add `"force":true` only when the release must be pulled
   immediately (e.g. compromised); providers on it lose routing until they
   downgrade.
2. `GET /v1/releases/latest` now serves the highest remaining active version;
   `/api/version` follows within its 1-minute cache TTL.
3. Repoint the convenience objects in R2, which the workflow overwrote:

   ```bash
   aws s3 cp "s3://$R2_BUCKET/releases/v0.8.16/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz" \
     "s3://$R2_BUCKET/releases/latest/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz" --endpoint-url "$R2_ENDPOINT"
   aws s3 cp "s3://$R2_BUCKET/releases/v0.8.16/darkbloom-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz" \
     "s3://$R2_BUCKET/releases/latest/eigeninference-bundle-macos-arm64.tar.gz" --endpoint-url "$R2_ENDPOINT"
   ```

   (`install.sh` uses the versioned URL from `/v1/releases/latest`; the
   `latest/` objects are for legacy clients.)
4. Mark the GitHub Release as a pre-release or delete it
   (`gh release delete v0.9.2`), and record the outcome in `CHANGELOG.md` as
   `## Release candidate vX.Y.Z (not shipped; …)`.
5. Do **not** re-register the same version with a different artifact. Fix
   forward with a new patch version.
