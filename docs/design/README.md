# Design records — what was decided, and whether it shipped

> Last updated: 2026-09-14 · commit `b725a72a8`

Plans, proposals, and architecture decision records. Each file is frozen at the
moment it was written except for its **Status** line, which says whether the
design was built, superseded, or abandoned and points at the page that
describes the system as it is today. Read these for the *why*; read
[`../architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md) for the *how*.

Status vocabulary (closed, [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) §3):
`Status: Proposed | In progress | Implemented (vX.Y.Z) | Superseded by <link> | Abandoned`,
followed by the record's date and one clause of evidence. The Status column
below repeats the vocabulary word only; the file's line 5 carries the evidence.

## Routing and scheduling

## Adding a record

Write the record and make line 5 — directly under the freshness stamp — read
`Status: **<status>** — <YYYY-MM-DD> — <one clause of evidence>.` Add a row
here and stop editing the body once it lands. When the design ships, fold the
as-built facts into `architecture/` and change only the status line. See
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) §8.
