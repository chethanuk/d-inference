# Models reference

> Last updated: 2026-09-10 · commit `28332cb6a`

Reference for `GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1/models/{id}`: every field of a `ModelEntry`, how the `model` you send is resolved, and the capability flags the API exposes and enforces. For SDK users and integrators. The catalog itself is database-driven — builds, capabilities and prices live in the coordinator's registry and price tables, and public names are aliases maintained by operators (`coordinator/api/model_alias_handlers.go`, [`../architecture/model-registry.md`](../architecture/model-registry.md)) — so there is no static list to reproduce here; `GET /v1/models` is the list.

## `GET /v1/models`

Handler `handleListModels` (`coordinator/api/models_endpoints.go`). Requires a bearer credential (`requireAuth`).

```bash
curl -s https://api.darkbloom.dev/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $DARKBLOOM_API_KEY"
```

Response `ModelListResponse` (`coordinator/api/types/types.go`):

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [ ModelEntry, … ]
}
```

What is listed (`listModelEntries`, `aliasModelEntries`):

- Every **active public alias** that has a desired build in the catalog, under the alias id. The concrete builds an alias points at (desired, previous, retired) are hidden.
- Every **catalog build not covered by an alias**, under its build id.
- `?include_builds=1` adds the hidden builds (operations/debugging).
- OpenRouter-only aliases are excluded; they appear only in `GET /v1/models/openrouter` (`handleListModelsOpenRouter`, `coordinator/api/openrouter_endpoint.go`).
- With `X-Darkbloom-Route: self`, or on a key created with `self_route_only`, the list is instead the account's own machines' models, filtered by the key's `allowed_models` (`selfRouteModelEntries`, `filterEntriesByKeyAllowList`). See [`../provider/self-route.md`](../provider/self-route.md).

### `ModelEntry` fields

| Field | Type | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | The name to send as `model`: an alias id, or a build id for un-aliased builds | `aliasModelEntries` (`coordinator/api/models_endpoints.go`), `modelEntryForConcrete` (`coordinator/api/concrete_model_entries.go`) |
| `object` | string | Always `"model"` | |
| `created` | int | Registry entry creation time (Unix seconds); 0 when no registry record | `openRouterModelFieldsFor` (`coordinator/api/openrouter_models.go`) |
| `owned_by` | string | Always `"eigeninference"` | |
| `name` | string | Display name | alias display name, else catalog display name |
| `hugging_face_id` | string | Upstream weights identifier, when known | `huggingFaceIDForModel` |
| `description` | string | From the registry entry | |
| `input_modalities` | string[] | `["text"]` plus `"image"`, `"audio"`, `"video"` when the build's capabilities include them; embedding models report `["text"]` → `["embedding"]` | `deriveModalities` (`coordinator/api/openrouter_models.go`) |
| `output_modalities` | string[] | `["text"]` (or `["embedding"]`) | `deriveModalities` |
| `quantization` | string | Quantization of a concrete build; empty on alias entries because an alias spans quants | `mapQuantizationToOpenRouter` |
| `context_length` | int | Maximum prompt+completion context of the primary build | registry `MaxContextLength` |
| `max_output_length` | int | Maximum completion length; `max_tokens` above it is clamped at request time (`ensureMaxTokensBound`, `coordinator/api/consumer.go`) | registry `MaxOutputLength` |
| `pricing` | object | `prompt`, `completion`, `image`, `request`, `input_cache_read` — USD per unit as decimal strings, from the platform price table | `buildModelPricing`, `resolvePlatformPricing`; see [`../reference/pricing-model.md`](../reference/pricing-model.md) |
| `supported_sampling_parameters` | string[] | `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `repetition_penalty`, `stop`, `seed`, `max_tokens` | `defaultSamplingParameters` |
| `supported_features` | string[] | Feature vocabulary derived from registry capabilities: `tools`, `json_mode`, `structured_outputs`, `logprobs`, `web_search`, `reasoning`; omitted when none | `supportedFeaturesFromCapabilities` |
| `deprecation_date` | string | Optional, from registry metadata | `deprecationDateFromMetadata` |
| `metadata` | object | Darkbloom-specific block, below | |

### `metadata` (`ModelMetadata`)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `model_type` | Registry model type (e.g. text generation vs embedding) |
| `quantization` | Build quantization; empty on alias entries |
| `provider_count` | Providers currently advertising the build (concrete entries only) |
| `attested_providers` | How many of them passed attestation (concrete entries only) |
| `trust_level` | Aggregate trust level across providers (concrete entries only) |
| `attestation` | `{secure_enclave, sip_enabled, secure_boot}` when hardware attestation facts are known (concrete entries only) |
| `display_name` | Same as `name` |
| `routable_providers` | Providers eligible to receive this model right now |
| `warm_providers` | Providers with the model loaded |
| `can_accept` | Whether at least one provider can accept a request now; alias entries aggregate across the alias's routable builds |

`routable_providers`, `warm_providers` and `can_accept` come from the live registry snapshot (`registry.ModelCapacitySnapshot`), so they change between calls; `GET /v1/models/capacity` (`handleModelsCapacity`, `coordinator/api/capacity.go`) exposes the same numbers unauthenticated with a 2 s cache.

## `GET /v1/models/{id}`

Handler `handleGetModel`. Returns one `ModelEntry` for a listed id, a hidden build id, or an alias; 404 `model_not_found` with `param: "model"` otherwise. Self-route requests retrieve from the owned-model view so list and retrieve always agree.

## How `model` is resolved on inference

`resolveRequestedModel` (`coordinator/api/consumer.go`) calls `registry.ResolveModelConstrainedWithTraits` with the request's constraints (self-route policy, media/tool traits):

1. **Alias.** The alias is mapped to its desired build; if every desired-build provider is saturated or too slow and the previous build can serve, the request goes to the previous build instead (`maybeFallbackAlias`). The forwarded body carries the build id; every response, stream chunk and usage record echoes the alias you sent (`publicModel`).
2. **Alias with no routable build** → 503 `model_unavailable`, message `model "<id>" has no available build right now`, `param: "model"`, **no** `Retry-After`.
3. **Build id.** Passed through unchanged.
4. **Unknown id.** Passes resolution, then fails the catalog check after the balance reservation is taken and released: 404 `model_not_found`, message `model "<id>" is not available — see /v1/models for supported models`, `param: "model"`. Self-route requests skip this check because their catalog is the machine's own model set.

### `model_not_allowed`

A key created with `allowed_models` can only use those ids. Any other `model` fails in the prelude with 403 `model_not_allowed` (`keyModelAllowed`, `coordinator/api/apikey_handlers.go`) before resolution, so the allow-list should name the same ids `GET /v1/models` returns.

## Capability flags as the API exposes them

| Capability | Where to read it | What the API enforces |
|---|---|---|
| Vision | `"image"` in `input_modalities` | Image parts on a model without it → 400; a vision model with no vision-capable provider online → 503 `model_unavailable` (`visionToolsFailFast`, `coordinator/api/inference_preprocess.go`) |
| Tools | `"tools"` in `supported_features` | Tool definitions are normalised and validated for every model (`NormalizeToolSchemas`, `coordinator/api/toolschema.go`; `validateToolConstraintPolicy`, `coordinator/api/tool_constraints.go`); uncompilable schemas → 422; only providers at or above the `tools` version floor (`capabilityVersionFloors`, `coordinator/registry/request_traits.go`) are eligible, and an inference-enforced `tool_choice` (`required` / named) cannot be combined with image content (400) |
| JSON / structured output | `"json_mode"`, `"structured_outputs"` in `supported_features` | `response_format` is forwarded to the provider without coordinator validation; whether it is honoured depends on the build's capabilities |
| Reasoning | `"reasoning"` in `supported_features` | `reasoning` / `reasoning_effort` are applied per model policy (`applyResolvedModelReasoningPolicy`, `coordinator/api/reasoning_request_policy.go`); reasoning tokens are reported in `usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` |
| Context | `context_length`, `max_output_length` | `max_tokens` clamped to `max_output_length`; prompts no provider can accept → 413 `payload_too_large` (`runInferenceAdmission`, `coordinator/api/inference_admission.go`) |
| Availability | `metadata.can_accept`, `routable_providers`, `warm_providers` | Zero routable providers at dispatch → 503 `model_unavailable` |

Prefix reuse is a runtime provider capability scoped to the exact model artifact,
prompt contract and request isolation scope. A family name or model-list entry
alone does not guarantee a cache hit. Complete SSD checkpoints support eligible
loaded Qwen and selected Nemotron Lightning recurrent targets (including typed
embedded MTP history), and paged GPT-OSS/Gemma historical attention;
the [cache capability reference](../reference/ssd-kv-cache.md#per-family-reuse-capability)
records backend and identity gates. This does not change API feature flags.

## Gemma 4 26B QAT runtime defaults

The v0.9.1 provider source enables these defaults only for exact build
`gemma-4-26b-qat-4bit`. This does not publish a catalog entry or change the
API feature flags above; other Gemma artifacts, including 8-bit, do not inherit
these defaults.

| Behavior | Default and limits | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Prefix caching | Encrypted complete paged SSD checkpoints enabled, subject to loaded capability, verified identity, cache key and tenant scope. A cache hit is not guaranteed; explicit cache disable wins | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/PrefixCachePolicy+Activation.swift` (`isEnabled`); [cache defaults](../architecture/prefix-cache.md#kv-layouts) |
| Multi-token prediction (MTP) | `mtp_mode = "auto"` resolves the catalog-declared assistant; adaptive decoding chooses ordinary decode or one draft token. Missing, invalid or memory-ineligible assistants retain target-only serving; explicit `off` and the process kill switch win | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Config/ProviderConfig.swift` (`MTPMode.enablesMTP`); [MTP policy and controls](../architecture/inference.md#multi-token-prediction) |
| Assistant activation | Requests continue during download and preparation. Network providers also serve during rollout jitter, then temporarily close admissions only for this model while accepted requests finish and the prepared engine swaps in. Racing/new acquisitions can receive transient 503; timeout or cancellation reopens the original engine without force-cancelling accepted work. Random jitter provides no fleet availability guarantee | `provider-swift/Sources/ProviderCore/Inference/MTPIdleUpgrade.swift` (`run`); [provider memory and availability](../provider/hardware-requirements.md#gemma-qat-assistant-footprint-and-availability) |
