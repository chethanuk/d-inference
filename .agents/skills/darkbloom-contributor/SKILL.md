# Darkbloom contributor

Use the repository's instructions as the source of truth:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and every narrower `AGENTS.md` that applies to files in
   scope.
2. Before editing, inspect the target branch and related open PRs so the change
   is based on current work and has not been superseded.
3. Determine documentation impact from `docs/AGENTS.md` section 7 while
   planning the code change. Update the canonical docs in the same commit
   series; do not wait for review feedback.
4. Preserve the cross-language and release synchronization points in
   `AGENTS.md`. Trace readers, failure cleanup, concurrency, and disconnect
   cleanup when provider registry state changes.
5. Create signed commits and confirm every PR commit is GitHub-verified after
   pushing. Amend and re-sign any unsigned commit before requesting review.
6. Run focused tests while implementing, then the component checks required by
   `Makefile`. Run `make docs-impact-check BASE=<target-branch>` and
   `make docs-check` before pushing.
7. Prepare the PR around the final implementation. Include the required Before
   and After Mermaid diagrams for both observable behavior and code flow,
   concrete validation commands, interface or migration effects, and material
   limitations.

If the docs-impact check reports a mapping that does not apply, explain why in
the PR and ask a maintainer to apply the `docs-not-needed` label. Do not bypass
the check locally or weaken the mapping to make one PR pass.
